The **Laboro Tomato** dataset comprises images capturing tomatoes in various stages of ripening, tailored for tasks involving object detection and instance segmentation. Additionally, the dataset offers two distinct subsets categorized by tomato size. These images were acquired at a local farm, utilizing two separate cameras, each contributing to varying resolutions and image quality.

Each tomato is divided into 2 categories according to size (normal size *b_* and cherry tomato *l_*) and 3 categories depending on the stage of ripening:

* *fully_ripened* - complitely red color and ready to be harvested. Filled with red color on 90% or more
* *half_ripened* - greenish and needs time to ripen. Filled with red color on 30-89%
* *green* - complitely green/white, sometimes with rare red parts. Filled with red color on 0-30%
