**Laboro Tomato** is an image dataset of growing tomatoes at different stages of their ripening which is designed for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. Authors also provided two subsets of tomatoes separated by size. Dataset was gathered at a local farm with two separate cameras with its different resolution and image quality.

Each tomato is divided into 2 categories according to size (normal size *b_* and cherry tomato *l_*) and 3 categories depending on the stage of ripening:

* *fully_ripened* - complitely red color and ready to be harvested. Filled with red color on 90% or more
* *half_ripened* - greenish and needs time to ripen. Filled with red color on 30-89%
* *green* - complitely green/white, sometimes with rare red parts. Filled with red color on 0-30%
